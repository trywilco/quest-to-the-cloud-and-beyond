      - text: First, **the release name**. Choose whatever you want. `anythink-market` would be an OK choice.
        delay: 1000
      - text: Second, **the path to the chart directory**. You have a prepared directory in the project root (main) folder. 
        delay: 1100
      - text: Lastly, **set the values `frontend.image.tag` and `backend.image.tag` used by Helm Charts to be `${Lodash.replace(Lodash.replace(user.repository, 'https://github.com/',''), "/", "-")}-latest`**. This tells the deployment to use images that were already uploaded for you to our registry.

      - text: If all goes well you should be able to access the application using the **[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)** that is connected to the frontend. There are two ingress hosts. The one connect to the frontend does not have `api` in its URL.
